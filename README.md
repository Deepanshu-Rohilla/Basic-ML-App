# Basic-ML-App


A simple script that uses ML5 for detecting body movements and different body parts.
Source : https://learn.ml5js.org/docs/#/

To include detection function => use pose.js
Similarly, to include the detection script => use yolo.js.
You can even use both at the same time but that may heat up your machine a bit.
